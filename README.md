# RHH_project

This repository contains all Slim input files for the trunk RHH simulations and the demographic simulations. These files are the .txt files.

run_dadi.py is a python script that uses dadi to run demographic inference. It invokes the demographies.py script, which contains all of the demographic models that we tested in this study.
